# www

a collection of custom css meant to override some websites that i use, both new and old.

## usage

i use [cascadea](https://cascadea.app) on safari and [stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) on chromium-based browsers.

## contents

- bing: bing search css (yes i use bing for the rewards points don't @ me)
- 4ch: 4chan css
- old.reddit: soft pink style for old.reddit.com
- abt: about page for firefox
- twil: edited version of twily's powerline css
- tumbl: tumblr css
- lain: lain css

## etc

- i'm a big fan of [darkreader](https://darkreader.org/) and am trying to make my newer styles darkreader-friendly
- some of the css from the tumblr style was taken from [this](https://userstyles.org/styles/108516/declutter-series-tumblr) userstyle.
